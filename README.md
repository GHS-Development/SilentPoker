# About Silent Poker
Silent Poker is a way for agile team members to vote on story points at their convience. When it is time for sprint planning most of the points are decided, what remains are the points the deam is not in agreement on. 
It allows those stories that need discussed the most to bubble to the top. Right now, Sprints in ServiceNow are supported.
